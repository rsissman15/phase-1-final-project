# Drink List

### Overview

Over the past year, one of my favorite weekend activities has been cooking a good meal and making a cocktail. I find myself googling (and googling for a couple hours) "Easy Cocktails to Make", so for this project I thought it would be a good idea to make a list of drinks I have previously made and drinks I want to make. I am hoping this will narrow down the decision making process for next time I make a drink in addition to helping out other people that want to make an easy and simple cocktail.
